The zip file contains all the contents of my personal project for my IB CS class in 2017-2018.
There were many components: coming up with a product to suit a client's need, coding a program (in Java) fitting of an HL student, 
documenting the entire process, making a video of the product's functionality, and evaluating its efficiency.
I wanted to be able to display what I had learned throughout the year in my project.
